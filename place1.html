    <p>
        The Lazy Lake is not in a hurry. It has never been in a hurry. If ambition were a body of water, this would not be it.
        The surface remains calm even when dramatic ducks land with unnecessary confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Local legends say if you stare at the lake long enough, it will stare back — not aggressively,
        but with mild disappointment. The fish swim slowly, as if conserving energy for absolutely nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is the perfect place to sit, contemplate your life choices,
        and then decide that maybe doing nothing for 20 minutes is a valid strategy.
